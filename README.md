# Juggernaut Takedown
Juggernaut Takedown is a Minecraft mini game with 2 distinct roles.
Will you pose as the Juggernaut, running for your life? Or will you become a Chaser,
and take down the Juggernaut with your team before time runs out?

## Roles

**Juggernaut** - There is only 1 Juggernaut per game. This role is equipped with full diamond
armor, a diamond sword, and enchanted bow. Equipment and weapons become more powerful with
an increased amount of players (Chasers).

To win as the Juggernaut, you must survive the onslaught of Chasers for a set amount of time.
If you are able to stay alive for the entire round, you win the game! You are more powerful
than those hunting you down, however your task will not be easy, as the Chasers can respawn
infinitely.

**Chaser** - There can be many Chasers in a game, all of which share a common goal: *kill the Juggernaut*.
Chasers are much weaker than the Juggernaut, however, they have the advantage of numbers, and can
swarm the Juggernaut as a team.

To win as a Chaser, you must cooperate with your team to kill the Juggernaut. Chasers can respawn indefinitely,
however, you must take down the Juggernaut before time runs out. If successful, you and your team will
be victorious!
